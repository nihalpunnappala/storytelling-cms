# ✅ Three-Dot Menu Fix Applied

## 🐛 **Issue**
The three-dot menu was not appearing on event cards even though the clone functionality was implemented.

## 🔧 **Root Cause**
The implementation was using `actionElements` prop incorrectly. The proper way is to add actions to the `actions` array with `actionType: "dotmenu"`.

## ✅ **Fix Applied**

### **1. Removed incorrect `actionElements` prop:**
```javascript
// ❌ Wrong way (removed):
actionElements={{
  dotmenu: [...]
}}
```

### **2. Added proper dotMenu configuration:**
```javascript
// ✅ Correct way (added):
dotMenu={true}
showEditInDotMenu={true}
showDeleteInDotMenu={true}
delPrivilege={true}
```

### **3. Added clone action to actions array:**
```javascript
// ✅ Added to actions array:
{
  element: "button",
  type: "callback",
  actionType: "dotmenu",  // This makes it appear in three-dot menu
  callback: async (item, data, refreshUpdate) => {
    // Clone logic here
  },
  icon: "copy",
  title: "Clone Event",
}
```

## 🎯 **How It Works**

1. **ListTable component** processes the `actions` array
2. **Actions with `actionType: "dotmenu"`** are added to the three-dot menu
3. **Actions with `actionType: "button"`** appear as regular buttons
4. **Actions without `actionType`** default to dotmenu

## 📍 **Result**

Now the three-dot menu (⋮) will appear on each event card with:
- ✅ **Edit** (if `showEditInDotMenu={true}`)
- ✅ **Delete** (if `showDeleteInDotMenu={true}` and `delPrivilege={true}`)
- ✅ **Clone Event** (our custom action)

## 🧪 **Testing**

1. **Refresh the events page**
2. **Look for three-dot menu (⋮)** on each event card
3. **Click the menu** to see "Clone Event" option
4. **Click "Clone Event"** to test the functionality

The three-dot menu should now be visible and functional! 🎉
